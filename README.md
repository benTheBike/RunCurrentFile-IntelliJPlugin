# RunCurrentFile-IntelliJPlugin

## Installation
Install to the .jar to ```./intellij/config/plugins```

## About
An entry shows up to the "Tools" menu that says "Run current file." Click that and it will run the current file open in the editor. This makes it much more convenient to run single-file programs.

## How it works
All it does is simulate Control+Shift+F10, which is IntelliJ's shortcut to run the current file.

## To Do
- Use a toolbar icon (similar to the "run" button) for this plugin
- Allow the user to customize keypress to run this plugin (maybe to CTRL+R or something)
- Publish source-code
- Set up "releases"
